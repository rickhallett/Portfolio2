                    <p>Having been previously trained within clinical psychology, I find myself in possession of a rare profile of
                        experiences and skills. Practicing within adult mental health services honed my communication skills, self-
                        reflection and ability to tolerate difficult interpersonal dynamics. Taking time out to study computer science and
                        software development taught me how to apply an analytical mindset in a more methodical way, forced me to
                        develop ruthless patience in the face of difficult problems and started a passion for all things
                        related to technology and programming. <br><br>
                    
                        Since I
                        have been employed as a software developer, I have had ample opportunity to practice application design,
                        debugging, refactoring, design patterns and clean coding practices. I am passionate about writing clean code
                        that is both efficient algorithmically and easily understandable by humans.
